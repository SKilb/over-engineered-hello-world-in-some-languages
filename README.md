# Over Engineered Hello World in Some Languages

## What is this?
This is a fun little repo to play what I would call reverse code golf. Instead of trying to make an application with as few lines of code as possible, this repo is to see how overly complicated and convoluted we can make the most simple application. Each language will have its own directory and an example of a simple way to do a hello world app. The dir will also include the current most over-engineered version of the code.

## How to play:
Step 1: Fork the repo
Step 2: Write the most convoluted code you can
Step 3: Submit a PR to the entry branch
Step 4: If your code is more over-engineered than the last, it will be merged to master

## Why play?
Purely for fun. There is no real reason for this than it is fun/funny to see.

## My language of choice isn't listed:
Submit a PR to the entry branch with a new dir, example of a simple hello world and your entry for an over-engineered version. It will be merged after review

## HTML isn't a programming language.....
Yes. I know. It IS however a language. I never put programming language, I specifically used the words code and language. Let the web devs play too.
